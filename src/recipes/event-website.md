# Your dedicated Event Website

In some cases, you maybe do not have your own dedicated event website. Or you need to create one, but you have limited time or no budget or similar.

**Good news!** ðŸ¥³

With every event on Add to Calendar PRO, you automatically receive a dedicated landing page.

This is mainly for easy sharing of your event, but it can be customized and extended to become your main event website!

**Let's explore the options...**

## ðŸ“‹ The building blocks

* You need to create your event (obvious).
* This event needs to be linked to a style (at the event setting).
* This event also needs to be linked to a landing page template (at the event setting).
* With the enterprise plan, you can also use your own domain, which should be set up at this point in time.

## âœ¨ Customization

The customization happens mainly at the landing page template level. However, the button style also affects the landing page style slightly. For example, box corners won't get rounded with a flat style.

At the landing page template, you can start by setting a title and intro text.

Based on your event setup, there are a lot of additional features at the event block itself - like the event description, date and time, or the whole inline RSVP form.
Therefore, the intro text is "only" an additional text block you can use to enrich the user's experience.

We recommend to also add some legal notes, so you comply with your local regulations.
You can also use this field to create your own small page footer.
For example, you could add some contact information and other notes there.

The "Highlight Color" defines the look of hyperlinks as well as other decorative items on the page. Use a matching brand color of yours and the page will easily adapt to it.

For the background, you can choose of multiple options. We usually recommend to go for a smooth gradient background, but this is up to your style and CI.

Finally, mind the SEO section, as it can be used to specify the base information used by Google and Co. This information also appears to the user in the browser itself - like as title in the browser tab or at his bookmark list.

That's already it! Playing around, you usually already find a bunch of options and ways to build your dedicated event website in seconds. ðŸš€
