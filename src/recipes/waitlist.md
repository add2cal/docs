# Create a Waitlist for your Product or Event Launch

Sometimes, you want to create a signup form, which is not bound to any specific date.

For example, when you want to create a waitlist for your product launch or just collect email addresses for whatever comes into your mind.

Technically, this would not necessarily be an RSVP, but we can still make it happen!

## 📋 What you need

You still need to create an event, but don't worry about date information.

Besides that, you should work with a style as well as specific RSVP template.

## 🧱 Setting it up

1. Create a new event.
2. Activate the RSVP functionality.
3. Deactivate the "Event Distribution" option. You will observe the date inputs vanishing.
4. Select an event group and set a title.
5. Select or create an RSVP template and (optionally, but recommended) style.
6. Hit the "Save" button and you're done!

## 🛠️ Integrating it

The integration is as easy as integration any other RSVP form or Add to Calendar Button.

Simply follow our guides for your distinctive tech stack.

## 📬 Monitoring it

All answers are stored at the event and can be reached via the respective button.
You can watch new responses flying in there. 👀

You can also export them as csv or JSON. 💪

## 🏠 Using it stand-alone

As each event comes with its own landingpage, our form comes with one as well.

You find the url right at the event page after creation as usual.

*Since we excluded all date information, this page looks slightly different as it only displays the signup form.*

By adding a landingpage template to the used style, you can still customize this landingpage. For example, you can add some intro text, an additional headline, change colors, and so on.

You can then share this page wherever you want and easily collect information.

## ❇️ How to optimize

As with all things you create at Add to Calendar PRO, you can customize the hell out of it.

You might already have used a specific style. This comes with a lot of options, of course.

Besides that, you should set up custom email templates and link the to the style.
This way, you can give all the emails that are send to the user (e.g. for signup confirmation) an individual touch and adjust it to your specific case!
