# Groups and Events

An **event group** acts as a container for multiple events.

It can be used for structuring and organize all of your data, or to link to an external calendar instead of individual events.
The latter one creates a button, which will trigger a subscription to this calendar. In this case, styles, RSVPs, and CTAs can be directly connected to the group.

An **event** is defined by its date, location, and other details. It is the core data element for everything you want to do at Add to Calendar PRO.

It can be one all-day event, a recurring one, or even multiple dates if you want to create a small event series. Besides that, you can define event more details (like setting a specific time zone).

You can connect styles, RSVPs, and CTAs with your event to active respective functionalities.
