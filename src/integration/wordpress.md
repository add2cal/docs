# Using Buttons and Forms with WordPress

## Step 1: Install the plugin

Install the [official package from the WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/add-to-calendar-button). 

You can find it directly from the "Plugins" page within your admin dashboard.

Search for: `add2cal`

Alternatively, you can [download it here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/add-to-calendar-button) and upload the zip file to your WordPress system. OR you unzip and upload the plugin manually into your wp-content/plugins/ directory.

## Step 2: Activate it

At your WordPress "Plugins" page, activate the plugin.

## Step 3: Use it

### A: Block

Simply use the "Block" within the WordPress Gutenberg Block Editor.

Add a new block and search for "Add to Calendar Button".

Click at the appearing button.
Add the proKey at the input on the right side "Block" settings.

### B: Shortcode

Alternatively, you can also use the shortcode `[add-to-calendar-button]` and add the proKey directly to it:

```
[add-to-calendar-button proKey="prokey-of-your-event"]
```
